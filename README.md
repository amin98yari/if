# get 3 input,print max
Algorithm: Find the maximum of three numbers
- Start
- Declare four integer variables: a, b, c, and max
- print "Enter your numbers"
- Read a, b, and c from the user input
- Assign a to max
- If b is greater than max, then assign b to max
- If c is greater than max, then assign c to max
- print "The max is " followed by the value of max
- End

# same from both side numbers

Algorithm: Print all four-digit palindromes
- Start
- Declare five integer variables: i, a, b, c, and d
- Set i to 1000
- Repeat the following steps until i is greater than 9999
  - Set a to the remainder of i divided by 10 (the ones digit of i)
  - Set b to the remainder of i divided by 100, then divided by 10 (the tens digit of i)
  - Set c to the remainder of i divided by 1000, then divided by 100 (the hundreds digit of i)
  - Set d to i divided by 1000 (the thousands digit of i)
  - If a is equal to d and b is equal to c, then print i
  - Increase i by 1
- End
